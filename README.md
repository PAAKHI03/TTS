#Components:        

1.Arduino board (UNO)          

2.PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor        

3.Speaker      

4.Resistors (for the speaker)      

5.Breadboard      

6.Jumper wires          


#Connect the PIR sensor:

1.Connect the VCC pin of the PIR sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino.         

2.Connect the GND pin of the PIR sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino.         

3.Connect the OUT pin of the PIR sensor to a digital input pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 2).     

#Connect the speaker:

1.Connect one terminal of the speaker to a digital output pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 10).       

2.Connect the other terminal of the speaker to a resistor.          

3.Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin of the Arduino.         

#Power the Arduino:

1.Connect the VIN pin of the Arduino to the positive rail of the breadboard.      

2.Connect the GND pin of the Arduino to the negative rail of the breadboard.
